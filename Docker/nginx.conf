# DEPRECATED: This nginx configuration is no longer used.
# The frontend container now includes its own nginx configuration.
# See: src/app/nanuq-app/nginx.conf for the active configuration.
#
# The new architecture has nginx built into the frontend container,
# which proxies API calls to the backend service directly.
